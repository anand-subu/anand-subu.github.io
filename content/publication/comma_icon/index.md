abstract: The ComMA@ICON 2021 Shared Task involved identifying the level of aggression and identifying gender bias and communal bias from texts in various languages from the domain of social media. In this paper, we present the description and analyses of systems we implemented towards these tasks. We built systems utilizing Transformer-based models, experimented by individually and jointly modelling these tasks, and investigated the performance of a feature engineering method in conjunction with a joint modelling approach. We demonstrate that the joint modelling approaches outperform the individual modelling approach in most cases.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper details our work in identifying aggression alongwith gender and communal bias from code-mixed social-media posts in different Indian languages. In this paper, we explore a novel multi-task learning approach that performs the best across all three tasks. We also explore different joint modelling approaches to understand which approaches work the best and analyze their shortcomings and strengths.
